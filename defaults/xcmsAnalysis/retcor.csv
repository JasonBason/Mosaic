method,obiwarp,"Chromatographic Alignment of ESI-LC-MS Proteomics Data Sets by Ordered Bijective Interpolated Warping John T. Prince and, Edward M. Marcotte Analytical Chemistry 2006 78 (17), 6140-6152"
profStep,0.1,step size (in m/z) to use for profile generation from the raw data files
response,1,Responsiveness of warping. 0 will give a linear warp based on start and end points. 100 will use all bijective anchors
distFunc,cor_opt,"DistFunc function: cor (Pearson's R) or cor_opt (default, calculate only 10% diagonal band of distance matrix, better runtime), cov (covariance), prd (product), euc (Euclidean distance)"
